Admission to this course is based on marks obtained for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate, awarded after successful completion of five years of primary school, followed by five years of secondary school. The Indian education system follows a 10+2+3 (4 or 5) pattern, so that a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 10 years of school, plus two years of PUC, plus either three, four or five years at university. Colleges offering a pre-university course are known as PU Colleges or Junior colleges in India.<br><br>

<h3><b>Paramedical - Allied Healthcare Course</b></h3>
<br>
<p>A paramedic is a healthcare professional who responds to medical emergencies outside of a hospital. Paramedics mainly work as part of emergency medical services (EMS), most often in ambulances. The scope of practice of a paramedic varies among countries, but generally includes autonomous decision making around the emergency care of patients.

In common usage, the term 'paramedic' refers to any ambulance personnel. In some countries, there is an official distinction among ambulance personnel between paramedics and emergency medical technicians, in which paramedics have additional qualifications and are accountable to a professional regulatory body<br>


The scope of the role varies widely across the world, having originally developed as a paraprofession in the United States during the 1970s. There are different models of care for EMS providers which significantly influence the scope of practice of paramedics in an area. In the Anglo-American model, paramedics are autonomous decision-makers. In some countries such as the United Kingdom and South Africa, the paramedic role has developed into an autonomous health profession. In the Franco-German model, ambulance care is led by physicians. In some versions of this model, such as France, there is no direct equivalent to a paramedic. Ambulance staff have either the more advanced qualifications of a physician or less advanced training in first aid. In other versions of the Franco-German model, such as Germany, paramedics do exist. Their role is to support a physician in the field, in a role more akin to a hospital nurse, rather than operating with clinical autonomy.
<h4>Duration</h4>
 It is about Healthcare workers who provide clinical services for patients under the supervision of a Physician. They are two year courses.

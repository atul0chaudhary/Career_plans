Any aspiring civil engineer feels at ease in the Indian Railways family as railways is a critical infrastructure of any modern industrial economy.

Let me share with you a few examples of some of the challenging projects that are being undertaken by Indian Railways which depicts the opportunity, skill, scale and strength of civil engineers working in Indian Railways.<p>

<h3><b>BANKING</b></h3>
<hr>

Dear Friend,

Many times this happens with us that we want to do something and accidantely get into something else, the same could be because of lack of information or lack of interest.

I was a investment banker before i decided to get into education and i am really enjoying currently so there is nothing which can not be done if you want to persue

Now since you wanted to get into Banking you could join or appear certain exams and join banking sector

1) Bank PO : Bank PO is the exams conducted by Various Public sector Banks which is considered to be the entry level job in banks, once you are able to clear Bank PO you would be called for next level of selection process, once you get into the bank you can make your path in Banking sector.

2) Post Graduate Programs: You may Consider doing a Post Graduation in Finance or Banking which would help you get into the banking industry and also would induct you in Middle Level management unlike Bank PO. The Only Difference here is that you have to invest 2 years for you MBA, PGBM program

3) Technical Jobs : You can also look to apply for Technical jobs which are normally available in Banks website, the advantage could be that you would get to use your knowledge of Civil Engineering, Since bank do need civil engineers for the maintenance and new projects.

As i Said earlier there might be a situation where you would be questioned why you moving to banking, so be mentally ready for such question, but my advice would be follow you instinct
